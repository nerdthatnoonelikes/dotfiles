# My dotfiles
##### Here is my personal collection of configuration files for the programs I use, to use these configurations you must have the following programs installed, `alacritty`, `vim`, `polybar`, and `i3-gaps`

## Installing on Arch Linux
```
$ sudo pacman -S vim alacritty i3-gaps
$ yay -S polybar (or through your aur helper of choice)
```
